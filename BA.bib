	title = {Efficiency studies of a liquid-scintillator detector based on Wavelengthshifting Optical Modules},
	abstract = {Search for Hidden Particles ({SHiP}) is a proposed Intensity Frontier experiment,
which is planned to be located at the {CERN} Super Proton Synchrotron. By using
large amounts of 400 {GeV} protons, it aims to explore domains of feebly interacting
long-lived neutral particles with masses between 0.1 {GeV} and 10 {GeV}. To suppress
background events, crucial parts of the experiment are covered by a large-area particle detector, also known as Surrounding Background Tagger ({SBT}). A possible
implementation for the {SBT} is given by a multicell liquid-scintillator layout instrumented with Wavelength-shifting Optical Modules ({WOMs}), which are viewed by
Silicon photomultipliers ({SiPMs})
This thesis studies the particle detection efficiency of a cell-sized prototype using
measurements with electrons at the {DESY} {II} synchrotron in 2019. It presents a revised data processing algorithm, which is able to achieve consistent results throughout different measurement setups. Furthermore, a newly designed fixation system
prevents the displacement of the {WOM} components while maximizing the optical
contact at the {WOM}-{SiPM} interface. A new cover not only offers more protection
against residual light, but also allows the readout electronics to be included, which
results in an improved stability.
The prototype was able to detect 2.6 {GeV} (5.2 {GeV}) electrons hitting the detector
front at an angle of incidence of 0
◦ with a probability of 99.9\% at distances between
electron beam and {WOM} of 600 mm (700 mm). Compared to previous studies performed in 2019 with the same detector prototype, an up to 0.6\% higher detection
efficiency was measured for 5.2 {GeV} electrons.},

@thesis{ZACHARIAS,
	title = {Efficiency measurement of a transparency-improved liquid-scintillator detector with {SiPM}-{WOM} readout},
	abstract = {This thesis was written in the context of the proposed {SHiP} experiment. The goal
of this experiment is to detect particles that are only interakting very weakly with
standard model particles. Therefore, a highly efficient background suppression is
crucial, because interactions with these new particles would only occurr extremely
rarely. The proposed solution for this problem is the so-called surrounding background
tagger ({SBT}). The {SBT} is supposed to surround the decay volume in which these
interactions would take place. It operates as a {WOM}-based liquid scintillation
detector and is divided into multiple cells holding two wavelength shifting optical
modules ({WOMs}) each. The readout is done using silicone photomultipliers ({SiPMs}).
The purpose of this thesis was the comparison of the detector efficiency using liquid
scintillator with purified {LAB} as a solvent with non-purified one. In a detectorbox
smaller than the cells of the proposed layout, the detection of cosmic muons was
studied. The scintillator box was equipped with a single Wavelenght-shifting Optical
Module ({WOM}) and an array of 40 Hamamatsu S13360 {SiPMs}. The signals are
then preprocessed by an {eMUSIC} board and eventually digitised by a {WaveCatcher}
digitizer. The raw data is then analysed using different {ROOT} routines.
The efficiencies of approximately 99.0 \% measured this way where about 0.8 \%
smaller than efficiencies measured using different setups. They did not differ by
more than the uncertainties of less than 0.1 percent. The reason for the large number
of low Npe events could not be determined. However, the light yield of the purified
scintillator is approximately 25 percent higher than that of the non-purified one.},

This paper reports on the structural design of {SHiP}’s decay volume, a {\textgreater} 2000 ­m3 conical vessel under vacuum that should host several large particle physics detector systems. In the field of structural and seismic engineering, the design study in a very multidisciplinary international collaboration has represented a stimulating research challenge. The goal of the design of the decay is to produce a structure as light and as slim as possible to stay within the geometrical envelop determined in the physics simulations. A complete study has been performed with all the steps from the conceptual design, including the interaction with other components and the plant systems, to the assembly procedures for the decay volume realization. The complexity of the case study has been driven by the need of finding the appropriate compromise between the physics performance, the structural aspects, the executive, constructive and operational issues, and the economical constraints. The assembly strategy, the welding techniques, and the expected construction time are discussed in view of the extremely complex installation phase. Building Integrated Model ({BIM}) methodology is also proposed as an essential tool to coordinate the entire process of designing and managing not only the decay volume but the entire project.},

About \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ muons per spill will be produced in the dump. To design the experiment such that the muon-induced background is minimized, a precise knowledge of the muon spectrum is required. To validate the muon flux generated by our Pythia and {GEANT}4 based Monte Carlo simulation ({FairShip}), we have measured the muon flux emanating from a {SHiP}-like target at the {SPS}. This target, consisting of 13 interaction lengths of slabs of molybdenum and tungsten, followed by a 2.4 m iron hadron absorber was placed in the H4 400{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}{GeV}/\$c\$ proton beam line. To identify muons and to measure the momentum spectrum, a spectrometer instrumented with drift tubes and a muon tagger were used. During a three-week period a dataset for analysis corresponding to \$(3.27{\textbackslash}pm0.07){\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}times{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ protons on target was recorded. This amounts to approximatively 1{\textbackslash}\% of a {SHiP} spill.},

The {TI}18 tunnel has been identiﬁed as a suitable site to perform these measurements due to very low machine-induced background. The detector will be oﬀ-axis with respect to the {ATLAS} interaction point ({IP}1) and, given the pseudo-rapidity range accessible, the corresponding neutrinos will mostly come from charm decays: the proposed experiment will thus make the ﬁrst test of the heavy ﬂavour production in a pseudo-rapidity range that is not accessible by the current {LHC} detectors. In order to eﬃciently reconstruct neutrino interactions and identify their ﬂavour, the detector will combine in the target region nuclear emulsion technology with scintillating ﬁbre tracking layers and it will adopt a muon identiﬁcation system based on scintillating bars that will also play the role of a hadronic calorimeter. The time of ﬂight measurement will be achieved thanks to a dedicated timing detector. The detector will be a small-scale prototype of the scattering and neutrino detector ({SND}) of the {SHiP} experiment: the operation of this detector will provide an important test of the neutrino reconstruction in a high occupancy environment.},

The {SHiP} (Search for Hidden Particles) experiment is intended to hunt for new physics in the largely unexplored domain of very weakly interacting particles with masses below the Fermi scale, inaccessible to the {LHC} experiments, and to study tau neutrino physics. The same proton beam setup can be used later to look for decays of tau-leptons with lepton ﬂavour number non-conservation, τ → 3µ and to search for weakly-interacting sub-{GeV} dark matter candidates. We discuss the evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model and describe interactions between new particles and four diﬀerent portals — scalars, vectors, fermions or axion-like particles. We discuss motivations for diﬀerent models, manifesting themselves via these interactions, and how they can be probed with the {SHiP} experiment and present several case studies. The prospects to search for relatively light {SUSY} and composite particles at {SHiP} are also discussed. We demonstrate that the {SHiP} experiment has a unique potential to discover new physics and can directly probe a number of solutions of beyond the Standard Model puzzles, such as neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter, and inﬂation.},
